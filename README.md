  [![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://lbesson.mit-license.org/)

  This node app interacts with a mysql database to maintain an employee management system. The command line interface uses Inquirer to allow the user to choose from a variety of operations, and then the app will update the database accordingly.
